<h6>Recently Bhartiya Janta Party’s official Twitter handle <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BJP4India/status/838297392168390656/photo/1\"><u>tweeted</u></a> the photo that made several claims about the government’s performance about MNREGA. Here is the photo tweeted.</h6>
<h6 style=\"text-align: center;\">         <img class=\"alignnone wp-image-248\" src=\"<<[site-url]>>/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MNREGA1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"516\" height=\"432\" /></h6>
<h6><strong>Summary:</strong></h6>
<h6>On examination, all the claims made with regard to MNREGA have been found to be false. Contrary to the claims, the number of works completed under MNREGA witnessed significant decrease.</h6>
<h6></h6>
<h6><strong>Analysis:</strong></h6>
<h6>An analysis of the official <a href=\"http://mnregaweb4.nic.in/Netnrega/mpr_ht/nregampr_dmu_mis.aspx?fin_year=2015-2016&amp;month=Latest&amp;flag=2&amp;page1=S\">data provided by the Ministry of Rural Development</a> through its website rebuts the claim and proves it false. We present the detailed fact-checking below:</h6>
<h6><img class=\"size-full wp-image-257 aligncenter\" src=\"<<[site-url]>>/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MNREGA2-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"682\" height=\"181\" /></h6>
<h6>Clearly, the claims made by the BJP through its official twitter handle with regard to MNREGA works are false and misleading.</h6>
<h6></h6>
<h6>The photo makes another claim about the financial allocations of MNREGA.</h6>
<h6><strong>Claim: Modi Government allocated the highest ever budget for MNREGA of Rs. 38,000 crore in FY 2017, that has been further increased to Rs. 48,000 Crore in FY 2018. </strong></h6>
<h6>The claim made looks true at first glance however a detailed fact-checking leads us to different conclusion.</h6>
<h6>The expenditure on MNREGA in the year 2016-17 was not 38,000 crore rupees but <a href=\"https://scroll.in/article/828253/the-rise-in-allocation-to-mgnrega-is-not-25-but-just-1-say-activists\">47,499 Crore Rupees</a> since the government had sought the additional funds through two supplementary grants beyond the budgetary allocation of 38,500 crore rupees.</h6>
<h6>Therefore, the increase in MNREGA allocation is not of 10,000 crore rupees as is claimed by BJP’s Official Twitter handle but that of 501 Crore Rupees Only!</h6>
